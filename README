EX3 â€“ HTTP SERVER
files: server.c threadpool.c and README.

Description:
This is a simple HTTP server implementation using a thread pool and the C programming language.
It takes in three command line arguments: the port number, the pool size, and the maximum number of requests that the server can handle.

The main function first checks if the number of command line arguments is 4, and that the arguments passed in are valid integers.
If not, it will print the usage of the program and exit.

The program then creates a socket and binds it to the specified port number.
It then initializes the thread pool with the specified pool size and starts listening for incoming connections.

For each incoming connection, the program creates a new thread to handle the request by calling the Handle function. The Handle function reads the request message and parses it to extract the request method, path, and HTTP version.
It then checks if the method is GET, the path is valid, and the HTTP version is supported.

If the request is valid, the program will check if the path points to a file or a directory and respond with the appropriate response.
If the path points to a directory, it will look for the index.html file and send it if it exists. If not, it will send a list of the files in the directory. If the path points to a file, the program will send the file with the appropriate MIME type.

If the request is invalid, the program will send an error response.

USAGE: server <port> <pool-size> <max-number-of-request>
